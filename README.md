## synetix WRO Future Engineers team

This repository provides information and knowledge regarding the ongoing progress, evolution, and development of our self-driving robot vehicle, which was created and coded by us, Mohammed bin Fahd and Rawad Alghanim, as participants in the Future Engineers 2024 division of the World Robot Olympiad (WRO).


## Engineering materials

This repository contains engineering materials of a self-driven vehicle's model participating in the WRO Future Engineers competition in the season 2024.

## Content

- `t-photos`: Contains 2 photos of the team, including an official one and a funny photo with all team members.
- `v-photos`: Contains 6 photos of the vehicle, showcasing it from every side as well as from the top and bottom.
- `schemes`: Contains one or several schematic diagrams (JPEG, PNG, or PDF) illustrating all electromechanical components used in the vehicle, including electronic components and motors, and how they connect to each other.
- `src`: Contains the control software code for all components programmed to participate in the competition.
- `other` (optional): Contains additional files that can help understand how to prepare the vehicle for the competition, such as documentation on connecting to a SBC/SBM, uploading files, datasets, hardware specifications, and communication protocols descriptions. If not needed, this directory can be removed.

##Introduction
An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement, and with the technological development it became a reality. In our work, we aim to design and build a car that is capable of moving by itself and take right decisions, moreover, we expand this work to avoid obstacles, this can be done by using an integrated system that is composed of two controllers, one of them is used as the main controller (Raspberry pi 4 Model B) that receives information and processes it in order to make decisions and send them as commands to Arduino mega controller which is responsible for sending signals that satisfy the commands.
